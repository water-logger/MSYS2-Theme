# Theme

Simple oh-my-zsh theme I made in vim with the help of spectrum_ls.
  
  
Theme Example:

## Requirements

* A linux based terminal emulator
* git
* zsh
* oh-my-zsh ( Obviously )

## Installation

To install the theme, follow the directions below:

* First, head over to your terminal emulator and type in:
``git clone https://github.com/water-logger/MSYS2-Theme``

* Next, type in:
``cp ~/MSYS2-Theme/msys2.zsh-theme ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/themes``

* Finally, head over to your .zshrc file and change ``ZSH_THEME="x"`` to ``ZSH_THEME="msys2"``
  
Now, restart the shell by typing ``zsh`` and you should see the theme.

## Notes

* Every command must be ran in the directory "~"

* I made this on Termux so this might not work

* That's about it
